Bugs
	Fixed an issue where the incorrect nativity Id was shown in the "New Nativity" dialog.
	Fixed an issue where version numbers were incorrectly compared, causing a new update prompt to appear regardless of wether the update was older or newer than the current version.
	
Optimization
	Added a progress bar when opening and saving projects.
	Added ability to report software crashes (with option to do so).

*New Features
	Added project settings under "Project>Settings...".
		Added ability to set the name of the project.
	Added workspaces and the "Main" workspace which is the default workspace.
	Added a "Manage Plugins" window which can be accessed on the top menu via Plugins>Manage.
	Plugins can now have their own dependencies which do not need to already be dependencies of the main software.
	Plugin API
		Changed the namespace to "ConwayNativityDirectory.PluginApi" instead of "PluginApi".
		Added ability to add workspaces.
		Added ability to add "view panes" and "info panes" with a specified workspace.
		Menu plugins are now loaded differently. A MenuItem is passed to the actual plugin making the API more flexible.
		Added a metadata storage api for individual projects and nativities
